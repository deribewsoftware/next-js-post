Post Blog Project
This project is a dynamic, responsive blog application built with modern technologies to deliver an outstanding user experience. The app utilizes Next.js for server-side rendering, combined with Redux Toolkit for state management and Tailwind CSS for styling. I have integrated Framer Motion to bring smooth animations, and React Icons for eye-catching icons.

Features
Responsive Design: The blog adapts seamlessly across devices, ensuring a great experience on mobile, tablet, and desktop.
Light & Dark Mode: Provides users the option to toggle between light and dark themes, creating an adaptable and user-friendly interface.
Interactive Animations: Smooth transitions and animations powered by Framer Motion, enhancing the overall user experience.
State Management with Redux Toolkit: Efficient state handling and easy-to-manage actions for better performance.
Next.js for Fast Rendering: Server-side rendering with Next.js ensures fast load times and optimized performance.
Tech Stack
Next.js: For server-side rendering and creating a scalable, full-stack React app.
Redux Toolkit: For state management, simplifying data flow across the app.
Tailwind CSS: For rapid, customizable styling and a clean, modern design.
Framer Motion: To add dynamic animations and smooth transitions throughout the app.

Design
The blog project features an attractive, minimalistic design, optimized for performance and accessibility. The interface is clean, and the layout is intuitive, making it easy to navigate between posts and interact with the content. The light and dark mode themes allow users to customize their experience based on their preference.

This is a Next.js project bootstrapped with create-next-app.

Getting Started
First, run the development server:

bash
Copy code
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying app/page.tsx. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses next/font to automatically optimize and load Geist, a new font family for Vercel.
